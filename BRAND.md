## Mission *(What We Do)*
UMass Boston Cyber Club builds the next generation of AI-augmented security professionals — through hands-on CTF competitions, real-world tool training, and projects that sit at the intersection of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.

---

## Vision *(Why We Exist)*
To be UMass Boston's premier launchpad for students who don't just enter the cybersecurity industry — but lead it by mastering the tools, techniques, and AI systems defining it.

## Core Values

### 1. The Augmentation Principle
> We do not fear automation; we harness it. A human with AI will always outperform a human without it.

We don't ban ChatGPT — we teach you how to verify it. We use AI to write boilerplate code so we can focus on complex logic. We treat AI as a "Junior Analyst" that we manage.

### 2. Trial & Error *(The Laboratory Mindset)*
> In cybersecurity, if you aren't breaking things, you aren't learning. We celebrate failure because failure is just data.

We don't shame wrong answers. We ask, "What happened when you tried that?" We encourage members to click the button and see what explodes — safely.

### 3. Curiosity & Persistence *(The Hunter Mindset)*
> We don't wait for answers; we hunt for them. When a challenge is hard, we don't quit — we try a different angle.

We teach Google Dorking and Prompt Engineering as essential research skills. We bang our heads against problems until they crack.

### 4. Ethical Learning *(The White Hat Mindset)*
> Great power brings great responsibility. We learn offensive tools solely to understand how to defend against them.

Zero tolerance for malicious behavior. We practice in authorized environments — VMs and CTF platforms. We respect data privacy and academic integrity.

## Member Value Proposition

Whether you're writing your first line of Python or preparing for your first interview — here, you build a portfolio that stands out. You won't just list "cybersecurity"; you'll list **LLM security, AI-driven threat analysis, and CTF competition experience**. You'll develop real leadership through collaborative projects, compete in challenges that mirror industry problems, and graduate with the skills that most professionals are still catching up to.

## Curriculum Overview — Spring 2026

The semester runs 13 weeks, one session per week (1–2 hours each).

| Phase | Weeks | Theme |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | 1–3 | Foundation — Linux, Terminal, First AI Contact |
| Phase 2 | 4–7 | AI Understanding — Codebase, System Prompts, Agent Building |
| Phase 3 | 8–13 | AI x Offense & Defense — CTF, MCP, Attack Chain, Showcase |

**Phase 1 — Foundation**
Students set up their environment, learn Linux fundamentals, and make first contact with AI as a tool. They begin OverTheWire: Bandit and understand what a system prompt is.

**Phase 2 — AI Understanding**
Students fork and run a real AI codebase (OpenCode.ai), read and annotate the source code, modify system prompts directly, and deploy a named AI security agent with a defined role and rules.

**Phase 3 — AI x Offense & Defense**
Students use their agent to solve CTF challenges, connect it to Kali MCP for real tool execution, walk through a full recon → exploitation chain, and present a live individual showcase demo on Week 13.
